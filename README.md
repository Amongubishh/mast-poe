part 3 chef app
Throughout the development of my app, I made several notable improvements and additions to enhance user experience and functionality. Below is a summary of the key updates:
1.	Enhanced Welcome Page: I redesigned the initial interface by adding a new, visually appealing welcome page that features an eye-catching image. This page now provides a clear entry point with two intuitive navigation buttons, improving the overall user experience right from the start.
2.	Improved Navigation:
o	Chefâ€™s Section Enhancement: I added a dedicated section for chefs, accessible through the first button on the welcome page. This section now allows chefs to easily edit, update, and create new dishes, streamlining the management process and making it more efficient.
o	Revamped Menu Section: The second button directs users to an upgraded menu interface. In this area, I introduced features that allow users to add and remove dishes with ease. Additionally, I included new functionality to display the total number of selected dishes and calculate the average price, giving users a more comprehensive overview of their choices.
3.	Detailed View Improvements: I incorporated a more detailed navigation path by adding a "Next" button. Clicking this button takes users to an in-depth view where they can explore detailed descriptions of each dish along with accurate pricing information, enhancing the decision-making process for users.
These updates collectively improve the app's usability, make navigation more intuitive, and provide a richer and more detailed experience for both chefs and regular users.
